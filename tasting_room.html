      <h3>Elstwhere Tasting Room</h3>
      <div class='spacing'></div>
      <p>Elstwhere is a sanctuary for beer lovers!</p>
      <p>The Elstwhere tasting room is a light hearted place of enjoyment that can only exist because of our love of beer.  It is a place to go recharge, drink delicious beer, and be with friends.  The tasting room is where we plan to share the fruits of our labor and relax.</p>
      <p>Located in the downtown Knoxville Brewery corridor, Elstwhere will initially be serving our favorite beer selections from local, regional, national, and international breweries.  We will offer the finest draft beer selections as well as bottle service.  In parallel we are working hard to complete the buildout of the Elst brewery to be able to serve our own creations in the tasting room.</p>

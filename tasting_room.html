      <p>Elstwhere is a sanctuary for beer lovers!</p>
      <p>The Elstwhere tasting room is a light hearted place of enjoyment that can only exist because of our love of beer.  It is a place to go recharge, drink delicious beer, and be with friends.  The tasting room is where we plan to share the fruits of our labor and relax.</p>
      <p>Located in the downtown Knoxville Brewery corridor, Elstwhere will open soon after the completion of the Elst brewery.  We will offer our flagship beers as well as a selection of bottles that are exclusive to the taproom.</p>

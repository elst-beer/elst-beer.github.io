Although updates have been absent, we have been diligently working towards opening the brewery. This summer we purchased a building in the 2400 block of North Central! Our progress so far has been mostly demolition and some discovery of the property. One remarkable discovery was that inside our building is a smaller and much older building that is mostly intact! Here are a few photos of the space after demolition.

We are now close to approval of our architectural drawings which will be closely followed by construction.  We have also selected a manufacturer for the brewing equipment and began the fabrication process.  Stay tuned for more details on the brewhouse!

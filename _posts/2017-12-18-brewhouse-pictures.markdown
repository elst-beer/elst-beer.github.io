Some people say... the brewhouse is the heart of the brewery.  The Elst brewhouse will be a 10bbl system
manufactured by [Smart Machine Technologies \(SMT\)](http://www.smartmachine.com/).
We chose SMT because of their ability to work with us on custom specs for the brewhouse and they are located close by in
 Ridgeway Virginia.  The brewhouse is being manufactured to fit the best layout for our space. Our mash tun will give us
  the flexibility to mash at different temperatures throughout the mashing process.  This is a technique that is used in
  traditional Belgian brewing and we feel that it is an important feature for the brewhouse.

  Our friends at SMT recently shared some photos of the equipment being built.  We are excited to see the finished product soon!
